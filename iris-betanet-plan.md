# IRIS Foundation Announces Plan for Betanet 
## The First Step for Mainnet Launch
 
The [IRIS Foundation](https://www.irisnet.org) is excited to be announcing the launch of  IRIS Betanet, which will happen in the middle of Feb 2019, right after Chinese New Year. 2019 is the Year of the Pig which represents carefree fun, good fortune and wealth.

Since July 20th 2018, the IRISnet community has been running the Fuxi testnet and has made several major improvements. On Nov 26th 2018, On-chain software upgrade was tested successfully by validators. This capability made it possible for IRIS Mainnet to start with POS essential modules while adding more advanced functions gradually such as [IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/docs/spec/ibc) and [service dispute arbitration](https://github.com/irisnet/irisnet/blob/master/WHITEPAPER.md) etc through decentralized on-chain governance.
 
Now the community is looking forward to moving beyond the testnet to a production environment. The core development team for IRISnet, [Bianjie](https://www.bianjie.ai), is occupied with final technical preparations for the Betanet launch. 
 
The Betanet, as the first step towards the Mainnet, is still an immature network, and community members who opt to interact with it must understand that the Betanet will undergo unscheduled downtime and require maintenance and adjustments. However, all transactions from Betanet are intended to be persisted as part of IRIS Mainnet blockchain \(please refer to [Betanet Expectations](iris-betanet-expectations.md)\). In addition, **locked tokens for early IRISnet private sale contributors and development teams will start to unlock from the Betanet genesis according to the locking terms** \(Please refer to [IRIS Tokens Unlocking Schedule](iris-tokens-unlocking-schedule.md)\).

The work plan for Betanet launch is at [IRIS Betanet Work Plan](betanet_work_plan.md)
