# IRIS Foundation New Validator Support (NVS)  Program  

To encourage building a more decentralized network, IRIS Foundation would like to support up to 50 new Validators to join [IRIS Betanet](https://www.irisnet.org/mainnet) through providing 100 initial IRIS tokens to start. After the new validator successfully joined network.  There would be another 300 IRIS tokens to this validator account.  

NVS is only a start to welcome validators to join the network, there is also a program in planning for Foundation to delegate Foundation's token to excellent validators in the community. Please stay tuned.

To be qualified, you have to meet one of following conditions: 

1. Proof you are experienced POS validators with more than 3 month history of performing validating service on one of following network:  Cosmos/Tezos/Polkadot/IRIS testnets etc

or 

2. With a github id with more than 1 year history and demostrated sufficient blockchain technology involvement. 


To join NVS, please submit a PR under https://github.com/irisnet/iris-foundation/tree/master/nvs with your node address on IRISnet as well as your backgrounds/qualifications. This is also a good way to let community know your validator node, and might consider your validation service in future.

Please join IRIS Validator community at Riot:  #irisvalidators:matrix.org. QQ (In Chinese): 834063323 to learn more

Happy validating and lets build a secured and decentralized network together!
