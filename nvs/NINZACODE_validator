Hi. I have been a Crypto trader and a minor since early 2015.

I have experience running a node for Cosmos testnet(gaia-8000~GoS). But I could't care my nodes for personal reasons(because of the work of the company). Now I quit my previous job and change my job to a validator.

 - I'm going to use it for IRIS only.

4. Cosmos

 - I have experience running a node for Cosmos testnet(gaia-8000~GoS) about 5 months to become a Cosmos validator. At that time, my validator moniker name is 'DIANOCHAIN'. I used this name as a gaia testnet account, GoS account.

6. KMS/Multi-cloud
 - When I run the server as a Cosmos testnet validator, I have studied KMS and multi-cloud sentry nodes. so I can run the system more reliably.

7. I am going to propose 1 Proposal for the first time since IRIS mainnet, like Cosmos's first proposal.
