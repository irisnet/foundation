# IRIS Foundation Ambassador Program 

## —— Be the IRISgardians of IRISnet Community

IRISnet (a.k.a IRIS Hub) is an Interchain Service Hub designed to support the next generation of distributed applications. Built with Cosmos-SDK, IRIS Hub enables the cross-chain interoperability while providing modules to support DeFi. 

At IRISnet, the community is a valuable treasure and an irreplaceable part of IRISnet's growth, and this is why IRISnet aims to integrate more and more initiatives regarding its precious community members. For this very reason, IRIS Foundation is launching an Ambassador Program to look for passionate IRISnet community members to become Ambassador of IRISnet: IRISgardians. 

As this name is a combination of Iris who is the rainbow goddess in Greek mythology, and Asgardians who use the Bifrost, a rainbow bridge to enter Asgard in Norse mythology, IRISgardians will collaborate side-by-side with the core team of IRISnet to build a new and decentralized world.
